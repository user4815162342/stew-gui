Jack looked up from his coffee. "Guys..." His hands were shaking, so he set the cup down on the coffee table.

The wind came off of the lake and through the screen, giving goosebumps. A loon called in the distance. Jack's friends stared at him expectantly, curious. Joe looked at Jack's shaking hands and up to his eyes, nodding. Jen smiled and leaned her elbow on the arm of her chair and put her hand under her chin. Jane frowned and glared at her coffee, a mumble came from the back of her throat which the others didn't hear, "she dumped him again, I bet".

"Guys," Jack started again. He let the words tumble out of his mouth quickly before he could stop them. "Imawerewolf."

Jane dropped her coffee cup on the table with a loud clatter, half of the coffee splashed out of it.

Joe and Jen's jaws fell open. "You're what?"

"I'm...I am," Jack said, then took a deep breath to finish, "a werewolf."

Jen and Joe looked at each other, than back at Jack, their mouths opening and closing like fish. Then they looked at Jane.

Jane had stood up, her legs set wide apart and her body turned like a fencer engaging Jack. In one hand she held a large crucifix, which she presented above her head. Her other hand was pulling a gun from her pocket. "Begone, foul hellspawn!"
